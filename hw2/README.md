First architecture : hw2arch1.ipynb (Maximum Validation accuracy: 71.15% after 100 epochs )
Second Architecture : hw2_arch2.ipynb (Maximum Validation accuracy: 73.71% after 100 epochs )
Third Architecture : hw2_arch3.ipynb (Maximum Validation accuracy: 80.03% after 100 epochs )
Fourth Architecture : hw2_arch4.ipynb (Maximum Validation accuracy: 83.15% after 200 epochs )
Fifth Architecture : hw2_arch5.ipynb (Maximum Validation accuracy: 85.14% after 200 epochs )
This is my winner architecture. 

K-fold on winner architecture: hw2_final.ipynb
After running for 200 epochs, the validation accuracy is 84.08%. When this model is validated on test data, I could achieve a test accuracy of 84.73%
